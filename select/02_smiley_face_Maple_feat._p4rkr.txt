I take that smile up off my face
In a different set of state
Even though I hate the thought of this, I think I might just wait
I'm nova goon all year around
You can never lay me down
I got some invincibility, so I'll just hold it down
I'm steady boomin' off the pills, heartbeat lookin' like a hill
Yes, I might die sometime tonight, but at least I won't be killed
Jk, I'm sober, hella clean
Can't nobody fuck with me
I stay inside of my shitty mood but I still fuckin' gleem
I got told to go away, so I went and went away
Wasn't found for a few days, hide and seek my favorite game
Everybody know my name, but nobody know my face
I stay hidden from the crowd 'cause I feel like a disgrace
People told me not to call 'em but get mad when I don't at all
Blocking all their numbers 'cause I swear they told me not to call
My patience has been tested and my annoyance is off the wall
Fuck off with your stupid shit, I do not care at fucking all
But it's okay though
I got those things to keep me occupied all day though
If I get bored, I tend to overthink my halo
I get real low and shoot at people, like a pave low
I wish I wasn't so damn dumb in situations
I'll just be quiet and I'll go patrol my stations
I stand together with my conscience, like a nation
I'll take your stuff, thanks for the generous donation, oh
I ain't off them fucking pills
They distract me from reality and get me fucking killed
And they ask me why I did them, it's because of all the thrill
Thoughts of possibly dying always filled me up with chills
And my angels watchin' over me, they're proud of what I've done
When I wake up in my bed, I know that I'm the fucking one
I have all control on me, so I've been chillin', worried 'bout nothin'
I have all control on me, so I've been chillin', worried 'bout nothin'
